		<p id="text">This conference will explore the consequences of criminal convictions for defendants, both within the criminal justice system (sentencing; prison impacts) and once the sentence has expired. Experts will examine the many ways that a criminal conviction results in additional punishment for repeat offenders and triggers various civil disabilities long after the sentence has been served. Each session will contain brief presentations followed by expert respondents and general discussion including questions and comments from the floor.
			<br>
			<br>Registration Fee: $35
			<br>
			<br>Students may attend the conference for free but will need to register by emailing <a class="link" href="mailto:robina@umn.edu" target="_top">robina@umn.edu.</a> Students should be prepared to show their student ID at conference check-in.</p>
